# Traeger-WebUI

## Overview
Hey what's up. Traeger doesn't have a web interface that let's us monitor our grills. So I'm making it myself. FullStack everything (Nuxt.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, Tailwind, Vercel, FireBase (auth)), even UI/UX design (Figma, Photoshop). The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to monitor and interact with a Traeger Grill via the web because I'm not a fan of their official mobile app. Stay tooned because I'm really close to having an MVP ready.

## UI/UX Design
For detailed information on the UI/UX design of the PyTraeger-WebUI, refer to this dope Figma design I cooked up. ![traeger-webUI-UI-UX-Design](traeger-webUI-UI-UX-Design.jpg)
